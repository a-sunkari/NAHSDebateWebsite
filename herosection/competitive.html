  <h3 style="color:#a40000;">Public Forum Debate</h3></strong>
  <p style="color:#a40000;"><br>A Public Forum debate consists of 8 speeches and 3 crossfires, each with a time limit.
  <br>
   <br>The first speech is pre-written and presents the team's "contentions," arguments either supporting or opposing the resolution. These contentions are backed up by warrants, evidence in the form of quotes or citations from sources. The two speakers from each team who presented cases then participate in a 3-minute crossfire.
  <br><br> During crossfire one person from each team participates in asking and answering questions based on their first speech. The first speaker asks the first question in the crossfire, and the rest of the crossfire consists of each speaker asking their opponent questions. <br><br>The second speaker from each team then gives a 4 minute rebuttal to their opponents case, refuting their opponent's arguments. Parts of this rebuttal are also sometimes pre-written and are known as "answers to" or A/2s. It is recomended that you have a very large A/2 document so that your rebutal does not have to rely on improvisation, unfortunately it isn't always possible to predict your oppenents arguement so you will still have to improvise. The Rebuttals are followed by crossfire between the second speakers. <br><br>The 3-minute summary, given by the first speakers, is given to both reinforce arguments and to refute their opponents, as well as to try and tell the judge which points the debate should be judged on. The summary is often referred to as the most important speech. The grand crossfire is between all speakers.<br><br> The final focus, given by the second speakers, is 2 minutes long and is used to explain to the judge why the speaker's team should win the debate.<br><br>Each team can take up to 3 minutes of total prep time throughout the debate. This prep time can only be taken in between speeches. Each team may use the other team's prep time for their preparation, however, the time is only taken from the team that decided to take prep time. Though it is not common practice, some national tournaments give teams additional prep time. For example, the Yale Invitational Debate Tournament provides both teams with 4 minutes of prep time.<br><br> Topics are presented as resolutions, meaning they advocate for solving a problem by the means of a certain position. Resolution options and official topics are released by the National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA) on their website.<br><br> Competitors are encouraged to focus on the "main issues" of the topic rather than search for obscure arguments. The resolution changes frequently and focuses on current events. Some topics spread the length of two months, while others rotate monthly.<br><br> NAHS Debate focuses on participating in 1-2 tournaments each month, creating a healthy preparation to competition ratio.<br><br></p>

  <p style="color:#a40000;">In each preliminary round, one debater is assigned to defend the affirmative, and the other debater is assigned to defend the negative. During the course of the tournament, you will be forced to defend both the affirmative side and the negative side many times. In each round, you will be assigned a room, an opponent, and a judge.
<br><br>In the debate, you will present a case that you have prepared before the tournament defending your side of the resolution, make arguments against the case your opponent presents, and answer the arguments that your opponent makes against your case. Based on the strength of your arguments, how persuasive you are, and other factors, you will be awarded with either a win or a loss. Judges will also give you speaker points (on a scale of 1-30) based on how well you debated and spoke.
<br><br> The format is as follows- </p>
<br><center> <img src="../assets/img/LDFORMAT.png" style="width:75%;height:75%;"> </center>
<br><br><p style="color:#a40000;">The structure of tournaments is as follows: the first few rounds, anywhere from 3 to 8, will be preliminary rounds. The purpose of these rounds is to develop a ranking within the tournament that will determine who proceeds to elimination rounds. Tournaments will “break”1 anywhere from the top 64 to the top 4 debaters (depending on the size) to elimination rounds. Those debaters that will compete in these rounds are the debaters that had the best overall record and speaker points from the prelim rounds.
<br><br> If you make it to elimination rounds, then you continue to debate as long as you win. At most tournaments, your elimination rounds will contain three judges (known as a panel) instead of one judge like prelims. Tournaments, typically, give out trophies for those that place well, as well as for those that have good speaker points.<br><br><br> .</p>
