      <h2> <strong> About </strong> </h2>

      <p>
      For those that are not interested in competitive debate - or simply do not have the time - there is still a fun, less strenuous alternative: debate club! Debate club involves the discussion of more casual and less complex topics with less rules that are easy to learn. It also does not require much preliminary research, as topics are usually decided on the fly. At <em> NAHS </em>, debate club usually takes place after school on Wednesdays, <strong> but due to the COVID-19 pandemic </strong>, debate will likely take place over Zoom!*

      <h2> <strong>  Structure of Debate Club </strong> </h2> 

      <p>


      Every week, debate club picks a topic to discuss. Similar to debate team, the topic is called a <strong> resolution</strong>. For example, a resolution could be, "Apples are better than oranges". Those that believe the resolution is true are on the <em> "Pro" </em> side, and those that believe the resolution is false are called the <em> "Con" </em> side. Before every debate, both sides have time to discuss arguments, refutations, and strategy with one another. 
      
      <br>
      </br>

      </p>

      <span>

      Past debates have been about topics such as - 

      <ul>
        
        <li> Climate Change </li>
        <li> Sports </li>
        <li> Education </li>
        <li> <b> And many more hot button topics that will keep you engaged... </b></li>

      </ul>


      </span>

      <span>
      
      Every debate has <strong> 4 </strong> main sections:

      <ol>

        <li> <strong> Opening statements</strong> and <strong> Arguments</strong>. The opening statement's purpose is to summarize why your side is right.  (E.g. "Apples are better than oranges because they are sweeter, healthier, and in abundance.") One person on each team makes the opening statement. After this, you must state and explain all arguments for your side.  All arguments must be <em> individual and distinct</em>. You <em> cannot </em> refute arguments made by the other side during this time period. Make sure to not simply list arguments but also explain the <em> impact </em> of them. Both sides have 3-4 minutes for this section  </li> 
        <li> <b> Crossfire</b>. During this time period (3-4 minutes), both sides can <em> refute/mitigate opposing arguments by stating responses and asking questions</em>(refute means to disprove one's argument, mitigate means to make the impact of an argument less severe and important). It is important that both sides debate in a <em> respectful manner </em> and not talk over each other. You <em> cannot </em> make new arguments during this time period, either. </li> 
        <li> <b> Rebuttals</b>. During rebuttals, you must respond to each of your opponent's arguments in some way. As said earlier, you can <em> refute </em> or <em>mitigate </em> arguments from the opposing side. It is important to respond to all arguments because ones that are not responded will be shown in the judge's flow and will likely lead to a win for the opponents. </li>
        <li> <b> Concluding Statements</b>. This time period also take no more than 30 seconds, and one person on each team makes the statement. Similar to opening statements, each side should summarize what happened in the debate that proved why they won. Concluding statements should explain how they refuted/mitigated arguments by the other side and compare the impacts of both sides to show which ones are more important. </li>

      <ol>

     <br> </br>

  There is always one judge (usually our captain, Abi Rajadurai) who keeps track of all arguments, refutations/mitigations, and impacts to decide which side is the winner (this process is called <em>flowing</em>).
