      <h2> <strong> About </strong> </h2>

      <p>
      For those that are not interested in competitive debate, or simply do not have the time, there is still a fun, less strenuous alternative: debate club! Debate club involves the discussion of more casual and less complex topics with less rules that are easy to learn. It also does not require much preliminary research, as topics are usually decided on the fly. At <em> NAHS </em>, debate club usually takes place after school on Wednesdays, <strong> but due to the COVID-19 pandemic </strong>, debate will likely take place over Zoom!*

      <h2> <strong>  Structure of Debate Club </strong> </h2> 

      <p>


      Every week, debate club picks a topic to discuss. Similar to debate team, the topic is called a <strong> resolution</strong>. For example, a resolution could be, "Apples are better than oranges". Those that believe the resolution is true are on the <em> "Pro" </em> side, and those that believe the resolution is false are called the <em> "Con" </em> side. Before every debate, both sides have time to discuss arguments, refutations, and strategy with one another. 
      
      <br>
      </br>

      </p>

      <span>

      Past topics have included - 

      <ul>
        
        <li>  A pro-life stance on abortion justified.</li>
        <li> Stricter gun control is required in US</li>
        <li> Civil Liberties trump Public Safety</li>
        <li><b>And many more hot button topics that will keep you engaged...</li>

      </ul>


      </span>

      <span>
      
      Every debate has <strong> 4 </strong> main sections:

      <br>

      <ol>

        <li> <strong> Opening statements</strong>. These should take no more than 30 seconds, and its sole purpose is to summarize why your side is right.  (E.g. "Apples are better than oranges because they are sweeter, healthier, and in abundance.") </li>
        <li> <strong> Arguments</strong>. Both sides have 3-4 minutes to list all arguments for their side. All arguments must be <em> individual and distinct</em>. <em> You cannot refute arguments made by the other side during this time section. </em>
        </li> 

      <ol>
