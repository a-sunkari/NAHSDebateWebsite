          <h2>NAHS Debate wins BIG at Harvard 2020!</h2>
          <p>
            CAMBRIDGE, MA - The North Attleboro High School debate team found much success at the 46th Annual Harvard Forensics Tournament. Here’s the breakdown of the tournament:
            <br>

<br><b>Junior public forum debaters make a deep run into the finals</b>
<br>
<br>The highlight performance of the 3-day tournament was by NAHS’ very own Aakash Sunkari and Samuel Foley, who finished with an impressive 6-1 preliminary record and the deep run all the way to the octofinals.
<br>
<br>Foley and Sunkari, who are novice and 2nd-year debaters respectively, initially had a disappointing loss to a New York 2nd year team. “We had control throughout the whole round. We don’t know why we lost, and we never got a RFD from the judge” claims Sunkari. 
<br>
<br>However, following the loss, Foley and Sunkari won 6 straight rounds against some of the most successful teams in the United States. Two of the teams North Attleboro FS defeated were on the unofficial Harvard “Threat List”, a list of the most competitive teams on the national circuit. North Attleboro FS locked their spots as finalists halfway through day 2, as they had a 4-1 record. 
<br>
<br>By the end of day 2, they improved their record to 6-1 and were locked in as the 16th seed out of 48 teams who broke into the finals. .
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, their run into the finals ended on day 3 in the octofinals round, as Foley and Sunkari fell to an independent New Jersey debate team.
<br>
<br>Aakash and Sam have never gone to a national tournament before, and this was only Sam’s third tournament ever. “The amount of success we had for two rookies to the national circuit is amazing. I’m even more impressed by Sam, who is completely new to debate” said Sunkari.
<br>
<br>A senior Floridian debate team praised Foley and Sunkari as “the best debaters [they] have ever seen” after being served a loss by yours truly.
<br>
<br>Foley and Sunkari debated the topic “Resolved: The United States should replace Means-Tested Welfare programs with a Universal Basic Income”
<br>
<br><b>Freshman PF debaters learn new skills and strategy at first national tournament</b>
<br>
<br>Freshman novice debaters Aprameya Pandit and Shawn Nassaney were thrust into their first big tournament at Harvard.
<br>
<br>Pandit and Nassaney, who are new to the world of competitive debate, faced teams from all across the country who each brought unique arguments to the table. The international aspect of the tournament increased the diversity of argumentation - something that could not be found at regional or state level tournaments.
<br>
<br>All of this, and the sheer competitiveness of the Harvard tournament, helped grow North Attleboro NP into polished debaters.
<br>
<br>After observing one of Pandit and Nassaney’s rounds, Aakash Sunkari and Sam Foley also pitched in with key observations and strategy to help North Attleboro NP become the best debaters they could be, including some tips on improving their rebuttals, crossfires, and public speaking skills.
<br>
“I think that going to the Harvard tournament was an amazing growth and learning experience for me and Shawn and even though we didn't do as well as we had hoped we came out with new experiences and tools that left us better equiped to do well in other tournaments. ” 
<br>
<br>Aprameya and Shawn ended the tournament with a [2] - [3] preliminary record. They debated the topic “Resolved: The United States should replace Means-Tested Welfare programs with a Universal Basic Income”
<br>
<br> <b>New style? No problem! Gupta proves his skill in first Lincoln-Douglas tournament</b>
<br>
<br>Though this is sophomore Dev Gupta’s first year of debate, he’s already switched between Public Forum and Lincoln-Douglas in a matter of months.
<br>
<br>Gupta, who solely participated in Public Forum throughout the year, decided to try his hand at Lincoln-Douglas debate at the Harvard Forensics Tournament.
<br>
<br>Harvard is a notoriously difficult tournament even for experienced debaters, so one might have expected Gupta to fail - however, he defied expectations and put up a respectable [2 - 4] record for his first ever Lincoln-Douglas tournament. That too, at Harvard.
<br>
<br>Known for his fiery debate skills, Dev found himself in some pretty interesting rounds throughout the tournament. As he was the sole Lincoln-Douglas debate participant at the time, he spent the majority of his time exploring Cambridge by himself. Meeting new people from around the country and debating people much more experienced than himself, he picked up skills at an unprecedented rate- finishing in the top 40 percent of all competitors. 
<br>
<br>Dev Gupta debated the topic Resolved: States ought to eliminate their nuclear arsenals.
<br>
<br>An interesting tournament indeed for the up-and-coming Lincoln-Douglas debater!
<br>
<br><b>Team finds time for fun amidst stressful tournament</b>
<br>
<br>The Harvard tournament can be stressful for debaters - after all, it’s one of the most prestigious tournaments across the world. 
<br>
<br>Notably, North Attleboro FS had round-after-rounds of debate with little to no rest in between. Aakash Sunkari lost his appetite due to nervousness before rounds. Teams had to scramble from debate to debate, as rounds could be in various buildings around the Harvard campus. Many rounds lasted late into the night, with the team arriving home at around midnight.
<br>
<br>But the team did find some time to have fun during the tournament.
<br>
<br>NAHS debate brought a football along with them to the tournament and found time to throw it around during breaks. A nearby library provided the space to relax and warm up in the below-freezing weather of New England. The team got a laugh out of a confused DoorDash delivery person who left the team’s food in the bushes, as she couldn’t find where the team was. Whenever the team found some down time, they would reconvene at a designated table and just talk about anything and everything. With loads of free time to go around the beautiful city of Cambridge, the team found themselves exploring college campuses and eating all sorts of food in the plethora of restaurants found in downtown Cambridge. Although some people (Aprameya) solely ate Chipotle burritos, Dev and Abi tried some delicious Japanese cuisine. When not debating, the team was building strong bonds that will no doubt last them long after high school has ended. 
<br>
<br>And of course, the team made new friends from across the country. Aakash and Sam became friends with the same Floridian debaters whom they routed during the semifinals. Dev became friends with multiple debaters across the country and stays in touch with them via Snapchat.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, this was a period of growth for the team. Gupta, Pandit and Nassaney rose to the occasion becoming polished debaters on the North Attleborough Debate Team, Abi Rajadurai settled in on her role as captain, and Aakash Sunkari and Sam Foley brought home the bacon - becoming the most prized and awarded members of the team. 
<br>
<br>All in all, a very fun and successful (but slightly stressful!) tournament for NAHS Debate.
