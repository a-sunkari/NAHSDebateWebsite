  <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;" ;>College </h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 30px;" > One reason to join the debate team is to boost your college resumes. Having an extra curricular such as debate on your resume sets you apart from other candidates for the admissions officers. By joining debate you can display your knowledge of real world events and issues to your admissions officers and look educated. After writing multiple cases and learning to appeal to a judge you will have greatly improved essay writing skills- another very handy college admissions skill provided by debate. By joining NAHS Debate you make yourself a clear candidate for the admission officers in charge of your selection, and you are admitted into the school, that you've always wanted to go to.    </p>
   <br> </br>
  <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">Skills </h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Debate has numerous benefits regardless of what your profession will be in the future. As a member of the North Attleboro debate team you will develop excellent oral and written communication skills, and will see improvement in your critical thinking skills. Not to mention, by frequently participating in debate tournaments you will develop effective tools for research, organization and the presentation of ideas, as well as strategies to overcome fears of public speaking.</p>
  <br> </br>
   
  <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">Expanding Your Knowledge Of Real World Events and Sharing Ideas </h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 30px;">It is widely agreed upon that doing high school debate will increase your knowledge of the world around you. You will be forced to learn the basics of economics, international policy, and public relations- expanding your whole understanding of the way things work. You will go at topics with an open mind due to the nature of debate, where not only will you have to argue both sides of a topic, but also share and recieve ideas of a topic during debate. Ultimately, debate will change the way you look at topics and teach you to be able to appreciate all sides of past, current and future political debate. </p>
   <br> </br>
  <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">It's fun... </h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Although we work hard on the team, we also have a lot of fun. We've all made some of our best memories, going to tournament and at meetings. </p>
